## The App
**Forgotten Logic** is a puzzle game app; in its current form its main feature is an 8-tile sliding number puzzle, though there is infrastructure in place for more logic puzzles to be added.

// (need to include info about the "problem domain")

## Resources Used
Our animations come from [Animate.css](https://animate.style) - the script is included in the HTML files.

The tile movement map is based on Danish Mughal's [Sliding Puzzle](https://github.com/danishmughal/sliding-puzzle).
